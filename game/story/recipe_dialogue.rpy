    "Brownies are easy to make, but difficult to master. You are acutely aware of this, having baked 
    a family recipe for them numerous times; you often feel as though something is just off, whether
    that’s in the consistency, the texture, or something entirely different, but you’ve never made a bad batch, per se"

    boss "[playerName], a good brownie is easy to make, but an excellent brownie is a baker’s white whale.
        Do not allow yourself to get hung up on perfecting what cannot be perfected."

    boss "Legend has it that the first brownie was a mistake, you know— a miracle was born out of a housewife’s misfortune,
            having forgotten to put baking powder in her chocolate cake. Brownies are a species of failure, not effort, [playerName]."

    "You heed his advice, allowing yourself to fail… perhaps too much. You are reckless with the portions of each ingredient,
    and end up adding a sprinkle of baking powder. Ironically, you end up with something far closer to a chocolate cake, although
    it ends up being a hit with your customers."

label brownie_blondie:
    "Having already misperfected the brownie, the natural progression seemed obvious: it was time to 
    make her less notable cousin, the blondie. While a brownie is always good, but hard to perfect,
    a blondie is always tolerable, and hard to push beyond that point. A few customers pick them up,
    but it’s far from your greatest triumph."

    boss "[playerName], have you ever heard of Blondie? The band, not the food. My honey always loved their music… I remember going 
    to a karaoke bar with a group of friends when we were young, and her commanding that cramped little room as she sung one of their old hits…"

    boss "Ah, my apologies. As for the desserts… I suggest making something that tastes a little better."
